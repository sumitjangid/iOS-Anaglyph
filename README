Anaglyph 3D Camera Application.

Anaglyph 3D effect is achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, typically red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. When viewed through the “Color Coded” “Anaglyph Glasses”, each of the two images reaches the eye its intended for, revealing an integrated image. 


Instructions to follow: 

1. Open the Anaglyph Application.

2. User will have two options for camera: 
	a. Front Camera 
	b. Back Camera   

3. User will get an First Alert saying “Take Left Image!”, by clicking on “Snap” button user will get the first image with the “Red Filter”. 

4. After clicking the first image user will get the second alert saying “Left Image Taken! Take Right Image”, by clicking on snap image user will get the second image with the “Cyan Filter”.

5. But before clicking the second image please offset the camera lenses by 2 inches on either sides in order to get the view for the 3D image.

6. Now click the second image.

7. Once both the images have been clicked, User will get the alert saying “Image Saved to Photos Album!”.

8. Kindly view the image in your “Photos” with your “Anaglyph Glasses”.



Features to be Improved:

- When we see through Cyan Color side glasses we bound to see both the images. Where as in Red Color side glasses we will see only one image.
- I tried using “BlendModeScreen” in order to fix the above issue but it worked partially.
